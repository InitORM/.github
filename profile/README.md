# InitORM

This organization offers an open source ORM built on PHP and PDO. It distributes the software it develops under the MIT license. It has an extremely easy to use Query Builder and DBAL. 

If you wish, you can just use the DBAL library. The [Database Manager](https://github.com/InitORM/Database) library comes with Query Builder and DBAL.

```
composer require initorm/database
```

If you need a more advanced solution, you can choose the [ORM](https://github.com/InitORM/ORM) library built on Database Manager.

```
composer require initorm/orm
```
